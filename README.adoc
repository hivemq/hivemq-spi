== HiveMQ SDK

image:https://travis-ci.org/hivemq/hivemq-spi.png?branch=master["Build Status", link="https://travis-ci.org/hivemq/hivemq-spi"]

The enterprise MQTT broker HiveMQ offers this free and open source plugin SDK with service provider interfaces. This allows everyone to extend HiveMQ and add custom functionality via plugins.

With custom HiveMQ plugins, it's easy to add functionality like writing messages to databases, integrate with other service buses, collect statistics, add fine-grained security and virtually anything you else you can imagine.

Plugin development for HiveMQ is as easy as writing a Java main method once you grasp the core concepts.

=== Using the SDK

A extensive HiveMQ plugin documentation is available {hivemq-plugin-docu-link}[on the official HiveMQ website]. It covers the core concepts and shows how to set up your development environment.

You can also clone our example open source HiveMQ plugins at {hivemq-github-link}[in our Github page].
